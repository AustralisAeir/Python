# Python

I'm a newly aspiring programmer trying to learn the beginning of code after being introduced several years ago during early education.

I always found the topic interesting but, much to my now discontent, never bothered to look deeper nor involve myself further after finishing basic education.

I'd like to try and fix that and this repository will hold any project files I intend on working with,  specifically tailored to Python.
